            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>IF ever you arrive to <hi>Bleſſedneſs,</hi> it muſt be by <hi>Faith,</hi> in the Bleſſed Lord Jeſus Chriſt, who is Revealed and Offered unto you, in the <hi>Glorious Goſpel of God:</hi> And if ever you Enjoy the <hi>Offers</hi> of the <hi>Goſpel,</hi> it muſt be by the <hi>Preachers</hi> of it: Even by the Miniſtry of men ſet apart, for the Work of Explaining and Applying, the <hi>Great Myſtery of Godlineſs</hi> among you.</p>
            <p>A <hi>Miniſtry</hi> cannot be upheld without a <hi>Main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainance.</hi> Now, while ſome of your <hi>Miniſters,</hi> chooſe to leave their <hi>Salaries</hi> unto the volunta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Contributions of the People, there are o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, who (ſenſible of what the Great <hi>Voetius</hi> writes, <hi>Hominum ſaepe tanta eſt Injustitia, Falla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eia, Lubricita, ac profanitas, ut Expediat, Contrac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum intercedere,)</hi> do make their <hi>Contracts</hi> with their people, for their <hi>Stipends.</hi> But it is well known. That tho' the <hi>Maintainance</hi> promiſed unto the <hi>Miniſters</hi> among us, be ordinarily ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry <hi>ſmall,</hi> ſcarce a <hi>Competency:</hi> and our <hi>Miniſters</hi> are moſtly of <hi>Calvins</hi> mind in this point, (as in all other they are <hi>Calvineſts,) Conſilium dedimus

The <hi>Miniſters</hi> not rarely are put off with a <hi>Pay,</hi> call'd ſometimes by the Name of, <hi>Synecdochical Pay,</hi> wherein by a certain Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure of Avaritious &amp; Sacrilegious <hi>Rhetorick,</hi> the <hi>part goes for the whole.</hi> There are multitudes, who from one end of the year unto the other, <hi>do nothing,</hi> towards the Support of the <hi>Evangeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Miniſtry;</hi> and tho' a <hi>Levy</hi> do in moſt pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces <hi>Compel</hi> ſome to do <hi>ſomething,</hi> yet that <hi>ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing</hi> is done grudgingly, as upon <hi>Compulſion,</hi> &amp; the <hi>whole</hi> comes not up to all that had been Engaged. If the <hi>Miniſters</hi> now ſhould go to take the Remedy which the Law gives them, for the Recovery of their <hi>Arrearages,</hi> they would find the <hi>Remedy</hi> worſe than the <hi>Diſeaſe,</hi> and by uſing the <hi>Law,</hi> wound the future ſucceſs of the <hi>Goſpel</hi> While they have been, by the <hi>Acts of Aſſemblies,</hi> Exempted from <hi>Taxes,</hi> they have in reality been <hi>Taxed</hi> above any one Rank of men whatſoever. Nor does any but the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, who in his Infinite Wiſdom orders His Holy Servants to <hi>Preach under the Croſs,</hi> know the <hi>Temptation</hi> that many of them have endured, when they have been defrauded of the <hi>Dues</hi>

            </p>
            <p>Now, Syrs, give leave unto one, who tho' he cannot be called, as Rabbi <hi>Tarphon</hi> was among the Jews of old, <hi>The Wealthy Prieſt,</hi> yet is <hi>at this Time,</hi> as little a Sufferer in this <hi>caſe,</hi> as perhaps any man in the Country, to Expoſtulare the <hi>Caſe</hi> a little with you, on the behalf of his more Suffering Brethren throughout the Country.</p>

If <hi>Moſes</hi> took ſuch care for <hi>his Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters,</hi> will any man dream, that <hi>Jeſus</hi> (the <hi>Son over his Houſe)</hi> takes no care at all for <hi>His?</hi> The word of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt requires of a <hi>Miniſter,</hi> 1 Tim 36 That he <hi>be given to Hoſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality:</hi> How is it poſſible for <hi>him</hi> to be ſo, if <hi>you</hi> be <hi>given to Coveteouſneſs,</hi> and <hi>given to Diſhoneſty,</hi> and <hi>Cheat</hi> him of his <hi>Maintainance!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I beſeech you, Syrs, Let <hi>Reaſon</hi> and <hi>Justice</hi> be a little heard, pleading the cauſe of your <hi>Neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected Miniſters.</hi> Your <hi>Miniſters</hi> demand not their <hi>Maintainance,</hi> as making a <hi>Lucre</hi> of <hi>Prayers,</hi> and <hi>Sermons,</hi> and <hi>Sacraments,</hi> and <hi>Spiritual Benefits:</hi> They are not the Sons of <hi>Simon Magus,</hi> to make a merchandize of things that are <hi>Spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al;</hi> nor are they unmindful of <hi>Simon Peters</hi> cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, about, <hi>Filthy Lucre.</hi> But while they apply themſelves unto <hi>Spiritual Services,</hi> firſt, it is a vaſt <hi>Labour</hi> which they undergo. The <hi>Miniſtry</hi> is a moſt <hi>Laborious Employmens,</hi> unto all that have any ſenſe of the <hi>Account,</hi> that they muſt give of their <hi>Stewardſhip.</hi> And ſure, a <hi>Maintainance</hi> is one Thing, in the <hi>Honour,</hi> belonging to them, that <hi>Labour in the Word and Doctrine.</hi> And then, they are unavoidably taken off all <hi>other ways</hi> of nouriſhing themſelves and their Families. Had they been brought up unto <hi>another Calling,</hi> or, would they yet betake themſelves to a <hi>meaner Calling,</hi> they would probably grow <hi>Rich</hi> as faſt as <hi>you.</hi> But they confine themſelves to their <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry;</hi> becauſe the Lord has Commanded them
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:109160:5"/>
to <hi>give themſelves unto it,</hi> and, <hi>Be wholly in it.</hi> It is therefore <hi>Barbarous</hi> to deny them an agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able <hi>Maintainance.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Briefly, Your <hi>Miniſters</hi> are deſirous to follow their <hi>Studies</hi> cloſely; and indeed, if they be not <hi>Hard Students,</hi> it is impoſſible they ſhould be <hi>Able Miniſters of the New Teſtament.</hi> In their <hi>Publick Diſcourſes,</hi> they are not fond of an <hi>Off hand Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;</hi> they be not for <hi>Spitting of Sermons;</hi> they would not <hi>give the Lord that which coſt them no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing;</hi> they would compoſe well Studied <hi>Meat-Offerings,</hi> not only for <hi>You</hi> O <hi>People</hi> of the Lord, but alſo for the <hi>Lord of Hoſts</hi> Himſelf, that <hi>Great King, whoſe Name is dreadful.</hi> It is needful, they ſhould have good <hi>Libraries,</hi> which, I aſſure you, are <hi>Coſtly Things:</hi> And it is needful, they ſhould not be like the <hi>Clerks,</hi> who having large <hi>Libraries</hi> which they ſeldome look'd into, were by the K. of <hi>France</hi> compared unto men with <hi>Crooked Backs,</hi> which carryed a load they never look'd upon; but they muſt ſit much in their <hi>Libraries,</hi> until they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come themſelves <hi>walking Libraries.</hi> Beſides all this; the <hi>Government</hi> of their <hi>Churches,</hi> takes up no little ſhare of their Time. And they muſt <hi>Viſit</hi> their Flocks, to pray over the <hi>Sick,</hi> &amp; <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort</hi> the <hi>Bereaved,</hi> &amp; <hi>Inſtruct</hi> the <hi>Ignorant,</hi> &amp; <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve</hi> the <hi>Tempted.</hi> &amp; give their beſt <hi>Advice</hi> unto the <hi>Unadviſed.</hi> Yea, they muſt on frequent oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions give themſelves to <hi>Faſting</hi> &amp; <hi>Praying</hi> in their own Retirements, leſt the <hi>Devices of Satan</hi> (who <hi>Deſires</hi> to <hi>Sift</hi> them) ſhould in any thing
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:109160:6"/>
prevail againſt themſelves, &amp; their Flocks. Now, Sirs, are any ſo forſaken of all <hi>Reaſon,</hi> that they will not confeſs it an ineſtimable Benefit unto a Town, for to have a <hi>Minister, (a Good man, and full of the Holy Spirit, &amp; Faith,)</hi> devoting himſelf unto theſe <hi>Divine Services,</hi> for them? Or, Is it <hi>Reaſon,</hi> that a man of worth, ſo <hi>Devoted,</hi> ſhould by the unworthy Niggardlineſs, of thoſe, whom he ſerves, be left wholly to ſink under his encumbrances? Or, Is all <hi>Reaſon</hi> gone out of the world?</p>
            <p>If your <hi>Miniſters</hi> are prudently Thoughtful about their <hi>Maintainance,</hi> 'tis becauſe they have Read that Word, 1 Tim 5. 8 <hi>If any provide not for his own, he is worſe than in Infidel.</hi> And thoſe men are truly <hi>worſe than Infidels,</hi> who clamour againſt an Honourable Proviſion for the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry; the <hi>worſt of Infidels</hi> do honourably <hi>Main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain</hi> thoſe that are ſet apart, for the ſuppoſed Service of their Souls.</p>
            <p>And that which may make the <hi>Reproof</hi> to thoſe men, who Rob their <hi>Ministers</hi> of their <hi>Dues,</hi> the more pungent is This; That there is a <hi>Sacriledge</hi> in the <hi>Robbery.</hi> Tis a <hi>Robbing of God.</hi> The Lord Jeſus Chriſt, in Heaven ſayes, <hi>Ye did it unto me.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Yea, You muſt allow me, to Advance this Aſſertion. Every man owes a <hi>Portion</hi> of his <hi>Eſtate,</hi> unto <hi>Pious Uſes;</hi> he owes it unto the <hi>Lord:</hi> the <hi>Great Lord</hi> is abuſed, if that <hi>Quitrent</hi> be not rendred unto Him. But what <hi>Portion</hi>
               <pb n="11" facs="tcp:109160:6"/>
of his <hi>Eſtate</hi> is it, that every man muſt Separate, and Conſecrate unto <hi>Pious Uſes,</hi> that ſo all the reſt may be <hi>clean</hi> unto him. I ſhould think, That ſomething about a <hi>Tenth part</hi> ſeems the <hi>Leaſt</hi> that can be. I know very well, that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny do and muſt give <hi>more</hi> than ſuch a <hi>Portion;</hi> and I know the <hi>Buſineſs</hi> of many to Ly ſo that they can't exactly give juſt this <hi>portion.</hi> How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, <hi>ſomething about</hi> this <hi>portion,</hi> ſeems a <hi>Good proportion.</hi> I find our Father <hi>Jacob,</hi> ſaying, <hi>Gen. 28 21, 22. The Lord ſhall be my God, &amp; of all that thou ſhalt give me, I will ſurely give the Tenth un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to thee.</hi> (Syrs, This was a long while before <hi>Moſes was born!)</hi> It ſeems, That man does not enough own the <hi>Lord for his God,</hi> who is not willing to <hi>give ſo much as the Tenth</hi> unto Him. Say, Will you not be the <hi>Seed</hi> of <hi>Jacob?</hi> They who <hi>beguile</hi> the Lord of this, are not ſo much as they ſhould be, <hi>True Iſraelites.</hi> I could never yet ſee an Anſwer, to that Argument; If the <hi>Tythes</hi> of <hi>Abraham,</hi> were the <hi>Rights</hi> of <hi>Melchize<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dek,</hi> then the <hi>Tythes</hi> of Chriſtians, (the Seed of <hi>Abraham)</hi> are the <hi>Rights</hi> of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt: For I am certain, That the Lord Jeſus Chriſt is, <hi>A Prieſt after the Order of Melchizelek.</hi> It may be, I have a little ſurpriz'd you with ſome Fear, that I am going to challenge your <hi>Tythes,</hi> as due to the <hi>Clergy.</hi> But I'll put you out of pain as to <hi>That;</hi> I do not <hi>ſo!</hi> The Lord Jeſus Chriſt has expreſly provided <hi>others,</hi> as well as His <hi>Miniſters,</hi> to be the Receivers of His <hi>Rents.</hi>
               <pb n="12" facs="tcp:109160:7"/>
The Improvement which I am to make of the Argument, is <hi>This.</hi> Let your Induſtrious, and Self-denying <hi>Miniſters</hi> have but <hi>One Half,</hi> of what one would judge proper to pay to the Glorious Antitype of <hi>Melchizedek</hi> in <hi>Pious Uſes,</hi> and I will undertake, it ſhall ſatisfie them. It will be but <hi>Righteouſneſs</hi> in you; &amp; you'l enjoy more than a little <hi>peace</hi> in it. Yea, 'Tis poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, in many Towns, if you would permit your <hi>Ministers,</hi> to ſingle out only ſome <hi>Two Species,</hi> (perhaps, <hi>One)</hi> of the many Bleſſings that make up your <hi>Harveſt,</hi> and receive only a <hi>Tenth part</hi> of thoſe Things, their <hi>Maintainance</hi> would be better than it is; they would gladly take up with it. This indeed I don't <hi>propound,</hi> but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>argue.</hi> Whereas now, they are Expoſed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to ſtrange Hardſhips; and they have over &amp; a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove given unto them, to ſtudy upon, that clauſe in the <hi>Lamentations, Our Wood is Sold unto us!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Yea, I have been told, That when ſome of our <hi>Miniſters,</hi> have been viſited by the Hand of God with <hi>Sickneſs,</hi> and mourning for two or three months together, with the Sighs of <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, I am ſhut up, and I cannot come forth!</hi> the people have gone to <hi>Substract</hi> ſo much of their <hi>yearly Maintainance,</hi> as their <hi>Sickly months</hi> would have come to. Alas, my Friends, common <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genuity</hi> would cry, <hi>Shame,</hi> upon ſuch doings: And <hi>Chriſtianity</hi> would have beſpoke rather an <hi>Addition</hi> to, than a <hi>Subſtraction</hi> from the <hi>Main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainance</hi>
               <pb n="13" facs="tcp:109160:7"/>
of your <hi>Miniſters,</hi> who are in your <hi>Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice,</hi> and only by the Calamity of <hi>Sickneſs</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrupted in the <hi>Service</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But, Sirs; what can you imagine to get, by thus <hi>witholding more than is meet?</hi> Oh, That you would Believe that word of God, Prov. 11. 24, 25. <hi>There is that withaldeth more than is meet, but it tendeth to Poverty;</hi> whereas, <hi>The liberal Soul ſhall be made Fat</hi> If the Spirit of <hi>Judas,</hi> cauſe you, to begrutch, all that is laid out upon the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, and His <hi>Ministers,</hi> it is time for you, to conſider, <hi>what Spirit ye are of.</hi> And if the <hi>Impiety</hi> of Pinching and Starving your <hi>Miniſters,</hi> be aggravated, by your breaking your <hi>Covenants</hi> with them, [for oftentimes, men are ſo much worſe than the <hi>Phariſees,</hi> that they neither <hi>pay Tythes</hi> nor <hi>keep Faith!]</hi> I entreat you, to ponder ſeriouſly on that awful Word, Jam. 5. 4. <hi>Behold, the Hire of the Labourers which is of you kept back by Fraud, Cryeth: and their Cries are entred into the Ears of the Lord of Sabaoth.</hi> 'Tis a Crime, you ſee that <hi>Cries</hi> to God for Vengeance: And I am aſtoniſhed, That the <hi>Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poverſhing Diſpenſations</hi> of God, which have been upon us, do no more put us, upon doing as that People, of old were call'd upon, Hag 1 5, 6, 9. <hi>Thus ſaith the Lord of Hosts, Conſider your ways: ye have ſown much, &amp; bring in little: ye look'd for much, &amp; lo, it came to little: why? ſaith the Lord of Hoſts: Becauſe of mine Houſe that is waſt</hi> Your injured <hi>Miniſters,</hi> eſpecially the more Deſerving ones, do make as little <hi>Complaint</hi>

as ever they can, againſt their <hi>Neighbours,</hi> or unto them. They ſay with <hi>Job, As for me, is my Complaint unto man?</hi> If it be, is to little purpoſe. But, when they ſee <hi>Debts</hi> oppreſſing of them, &amp; the <hi>Neceſsaries</hi> of Life hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly allowed unto them &amp; their Families, while their <hi>People</hi> can throw away upon <hi>Pride,</hi> &amp; upon <hi>Drink,</hi> and upon their <hi>Diverſions,</hi> the Money that would have been a thouſand times better aſſign'd unto any <hi>Vertuous Uſes</hi> in the world, <hi>Then</hi> they are <hi>Overwhelmed, &amp; they pour out their complaint before the Lord.</hi> They mourn be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Lord, in Secret places, &amp; cry out, <hi>Lord,</hi> I <hi>am Oppreſsed, undertake for me!</hi> But an incredible wrath from the Jealous &amp; Wronged Lord Jeſus Chriſt, breaks forth againſt the People, that are guilty of ſo great an <hi>Oppreſſion</hi>
               <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I tell you truly, Except it be the <hi>Blood</hi> of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>Crying</hi> againſt a <hi>People,</hi> I know not, whether any <hi>Cry</hi> more terrible can go up to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, than the <hi>Crying wants</hi> &amp; <hi>Straits</hi> of His Holy <hi>Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters.</hi> I have been told, That if the <hi>Tavern-keepers</hi> in many Towns, would bring in true Accounts, of what Money they have received in the Needleſs viſits of their Neighbours to the Taverns, the Sum would vaſtly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed all that is in thoſe Towns laid out upon the <hi>Houſe</hi> of God. This is a Thing that <hi>Cryes</hi> to Heaven, for the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moval of a Deſpiſed Goſpel; Believe it, Sirs, Believe it.</p>
            <p>Tis a wonderful Damage, that you do your ſelves, if it were no more than <hi>This;</hi> That by taking off your <hi>Miniſters</hi> from their <hi>Studies,</hi> you Stunt their <hi>Abilities,</hi> &amp; Cramp their <hi>Accompliſhments,</hi> &amp; looſe the vaſt Good that would thereby accrue unto your ſelves. It ſeems, you would have your <hi>Miniſters</hi> to be the <hi>Stars,</hi> rather than the <hi>Lamps</hi> of the Churches, &amp; like <hi>Stars,</hi> to <hi>Shine,</hi> without the ſupply of any <hi>Earthly Contributions:</hi> But they are <hi>Lamps;</hi> and how ſhould they do any other than <hi>Burn Dim,</hi> if you don't ſupply them? <hi>Antigonus</hi>
               <pb n="15" facs="tcp:109160:8"/>
admiring to ſee, the Diligent Philoſopher <hi>Cleanthes,</hi> grinding his own <hi>Corn</hi> at the Mill, <hi>Cleanthes</hi> told him, <hi>I must either grind or Starve:</hi> whereupon <hi>Antigonus</hi> noted it as a great Indignity, that the <hi>Hands</hi> whereby Excellent Things had been written, ſhould be galled with <hi>Mechanick Labours.</hi> But how often do the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple cauſe the <hi>Hands</hi> which have <hi>Baptized</hi> them, and which break the <hi>Bread of Life</hi> unto them, to be <hi>Galled</hi> with <hi>Inferiour Labours,</hi> for the getting of <hi>Bread?</hi> They muſt either <hi>Plough,</hi> or <hi>Starve.</hi> This muſt needs ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der their <hi>Ministry,</hi> leſs <hi>Edifying,</hi> to you, than it would have been. Yea, your <hi>Unrighteouſneſs</hi> towards your <hi>Ministers</hi> may be puniſhed by the <hi>Righteous God</hi> with <hi>Spiritual Plagues;</hi> and God may give you up to ſuch a <hi>Spirit of Slumber,</hi> that their <hi>Miniſtry</hi> ſhall never more be <hi>Profitable</hi> to you: for the moſt Lively <hi>Miniſtry</hi> in the world, will do good no further than that the Bleſſing of God accompanies it. When people are call'd upon to <hi>Maintain</hi> their <hi>Miniſters,</hi> tis added, Gal. 6. 8. <hi>He that ſoweth to the Spirit, ſhall of the Spirit reap life Everlasting.</hi> If you begrutch a ſmall Pittance of of your <hi>Eſtates,</hi> for the <hi>Maintainance</hi> of them that are to Feed your <hi>Spirits,</hi> God may be ſo provoked, as to Reſolve, that you ſhall <hi>Reap</hi> no <hi>Spiritual Advantages</hi> from their <hi>Miniſtry,</hi> but remain <hi>Barren Figtrees,</hi> till you are <hi>Cut down</hi> for the Fire of His Burning Indignation. Yea, Sirs, If ever you <hi>did</hi> get <hi>Good</hi> by your Miniſters, one would think, you could not think any thing too <hi>Good</hi> for them! And what if the provocation ſhould have this Effect alſo, That God will <hi>Take away</hi> your Excellent <hi>Miniſters,</hi> &amp; then, either leave you a long while <hi>Deſtitute,</hi> &amp; per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps <hi>Divided;</hi> or ſend <hi>Succeſſors,</hi> that ſhall not be men of ſuch Good <hi>Principles</hi> &amp; <hi>Properties,</hi> as thoſe <hi>men of God,</hi> that went before them? <hi>National Synods</hi> of the <hi>French Churches</hi> complained, That the <hi>Ingratitude</hi> of people refuſing
